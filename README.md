# Lambada

Lambada is a functional language heavily inspired by lambda calculus.
The language attempts to be minimalistic, and implements as much as possible within the language itself.

# Plans

## What should it look like?

Values, lambda expressions, and application.

'''haskell
double = \x -> * 2 x

five = 5

main = double five
'''

'''haskell
true = \x -> \y -> 

five = 5

main = double five
'''

## Features

## Planned features
* Values
* Lambda abstractions
* Application of lambda abstractions on values
* Evaluation of expressions

## Possible future features
* A way of printing values?
* Shift/reset?
* Try/catch?
* New data types?
